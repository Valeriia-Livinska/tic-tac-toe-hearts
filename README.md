little game for english teacher

You can either enter words into the game fields or simply play for fun.

Instruction:

1. Word sets are stored individually, each user has his own, and others are unavailable.
2. The maximum number of saving sets is 15.
3. Font size on board changes the size of the text in the board cells.
4. You can cancel only one last move.
5. After the start of the game (first move), the ability to change the players' icons is blocked. The option is available after the end of the round before the first turn.
6. Completing words in a new set:
   - it is possible to input values in cells and create a set;
   - it is possible to switch to input as a string (but if words were entered in individual cells before that, after the start of filling in the string, the cells will be cleared and re-filled with words that will be entered in the string);
   - words from the string fill the cells and can be checked, but edited only in the string mode;
   - words from the string fill the cells, but filling in the cells will not fill the string;
